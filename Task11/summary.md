The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student working part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain localized over the heart area lasting a few seconds and recurring over the past three days. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. There are no associated symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or weakness. The patient recently recovered from the flu but currently has no viral symptoms. There is no past medical history, no medication use except occasional Tylenol, and no allergies. Family history is significant for the patient's father, who had a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient considerable concern about having a heart attack. The patient does not smoke, drink occasionally, and denies drug use. The healthcare provider plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to investigate further, reassuring the patient to avoid excessive worry pending results.
