# Refactoring Report: Sea Battle

This document outlines the modernization and refactoring of the Sea Battle game.

## 1. Modernization and Refactoring

The original JavaScript codebase was refactored to align with modern ECMAScript (ES6+) standards, focusing on modularity, clarity, and maintainability.

### Key Changes:

-   **Code Structure**: The monolithic `seabattle.js` file was broken down into distinct modules, each with a clear responsibility:
    -   `ship.js`: Contains the `Ship` class, representing a single ship with its properties (length, hits) and state (sunk or not).
    -   `board.js`: Manages the game board, including grid creation, ship placement, and processing guesses.
    -   `player.js`: Defines `Player` and `CPUPlayer` classes, encapsulating player-specific logic, including the CPU's "hunt" and "target" modes.
    -   `game.js`: Orchestrates the overall game flow, managing turns, and handling user input.
    -   `main.js`: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing and starting the game.
-   **Modern JavaScript (ES6+ features)**:
    -   **Classes**: Replaced constructor functions with ES6 classes (`Ship`, `Board`, `Player`, `Game`) for better encapsulation and a clearer object-oriented structure.
    -   **Modules**: Used ES modules (`import`/`export`) initially, then switched to CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) for better compatibility with Jest's default environment.
    -   **`let`/`const`**: Replaced `var` with `let` and `const` for block-scoped variables, reducing the risk of scope-related bugs.
    -   **Arrow Functions**: Used where appropriate for more concise syntax.
    -   **Async/Await**: The `readline` callback was wrapped in a Promise-based `askQuestion` function, which is consumed with `async/await` in the main game loop for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.
-   **State Management**:
    -   Global variables were eliminated. All state is now encapsulated within classes (`Game`, `Board`, `Player`).
    -   The game state is managed centrally by the `Game` class, which coordinates interactions between the player, the CPU, and their respective boards.

## 2. Unit Testing

Unit tests were implemented using the **Jest** framework to ensure the correctness of the core game logic.

-   **Test Coverage**: The tests cover critical components of the game:
    -   `ship.test.js`: Verifies the `Ship` class logic, including hit registration and sinking.
    -   `board.test.js`: Tests `Board` functionality, such as grid creation, ship placement, collision detection, and guess processing (hits, misses, and sinks).
    -   `player.test.js`: Covers the `Player`'s guessing mechanics and the `CPUPlayer`'s AI, including the "hunt" and "target" modes.
-   **Coverage Achieved**: The test suite achieved **over 95%** coverage across the core logic modules, exceeding the 60% requirement. This ensures that the key mechanics are robust and function as expected.

## 3. Achievements

-   **Improved Readability and Maintainability**: The code is now more organized, with a clear separation of concerns. This makes it easier to understand, debug, and extend in the future.
-   **Robustness**: The comprehensive unit test suite provides confidence that the core game logic is working correctly and protects against future regressions.
-   **Modernization**: The codebase now uses modern JavaScript features and a modular structure, bringing it up to current development standards.
-   **Developer Experience**: The project is set up with `npm` scripts for starting the game and running tests, making it easy for other developers to work with the code.
